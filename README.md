# Financial-Reconciliation-Dashboard
An end-to-end data analytics project designed to track and visualize reconciliation status across 20,000+ financial transactions, built from scratch using Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for insightful, executive-ready dashboards.

This dashboard enables teams to:
- Identify mismatches and discrepancies in transaction records
- Track reconciliation trends over time
- Monitor branch-level transaction activities
- Highlight approvals and pending issues

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ Initial data cleaning and transformation
- **Power BI** â€“ Data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations
- **DAX** â€“ Used for KPI metrics, trends, conditional formatting, and slicers
- **GitHub** â€“ Version control and documentation

## Data Cleaning Process (Excel)

- **Handled missing values** in key columns like `Date`, `Currency`, and `Comments`
- Created a `MonthYear` column from `Date` to support trend analysis
- Cleaned and standardized fields like:
  - `Approval Status` â†’ values: Approved, Pending, Rejected, Unknown
  - `Reconciliation Status` â†’ values: Matched, Mismatched, Pending, Unknown
- Used logic to populate empty `Comment` fields based on `Approval Status`
- Replaced blanks in `Currency` based on the most common currency per branch
